    "intro": "The eight edition of the International Summer School on Software Engineering intends to provide a contribution to PhD students and academic and industrial researchers on latest findings in the field of Software Engineering. The invited lecturers are internationally recognised research leaders and will cover very relevant topics for the scientific community, including Requirements Engineering, Service Oriented Architectures, Empirical Software Engineering, Software Processes, and Source Code Analysis. The program of the school will aim at creating discussion forums between lecturers and industrial and academic attendees. Submission of student talks and tool demos will also be encouraged to further stimulate the discussion.",
